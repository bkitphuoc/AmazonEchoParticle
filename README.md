# AmazonEchoParticle

This is an example of using [Amazon Echo] (Alexa) as an interface for IoT devices. It communicates with the [Particle] (ex Spark core) Cloud API and allows you to ask the temperature reading and control a digital pin.

The code for the Particle is in **particle.c** while for the Echo app an Amazon Lambda function is used (**echoapp.js**) in Node.js

Check my [blog post] for more details on how to create and configure the Amazon Echo app (Skill).
